        <h1>Nowadays, watching a movie or a tv program with relatives is uncommon and everyone has their own preferences. As a result, people like to watch movies/shows on their phones or computers. The platform you're using, whether it's MX Player, Amazon Prime, or Netflix, is an OTT platform.Over-the-top (OTT) platforms are video and audio streaming and viewing sites that began as content streaming channels but quickly expanded into the creation and distribution of short films, motion pictures, documentaries, and web series itself.
          These apps have a variety of content and utilise artificial intelligence to recommend content to consumers depending on their earlier browsing history on the app. Most OTT sites have some free content and require a monthly membership fee for paid content that is not available elsewhere.
          The premium content is typically developed and distributed by the OTT platform itself, in collaboration with existing production houses that have previously produced feature films.</h1>

          <p>Disney plus Hotstar streaming service was launched in 2019 in America and then continued to expand across the globe. It has now established itself in many countries, including India, although here it has collaborated with Star India and not as a standalone app.
            Its latest launch in India as Disney+ Hotstar in 2020 saw new changes in terms of the plan prices, content on the platform, etc. Disney+ Hotstar's content is available in 7 Indian regional languages like Hindi, Kannada, Bengali, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, and Marathi. It now competes with two other extremely popular services in India, which are Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.The latest merger in the streaming platform that has completely taken the sector by a storm is between Disney+Hotstar. Hotstar is an Indian streaming service by Star India. The Walt Disney Company took over 21st Century Fox for $71 Billion. This acquisition made Star India which is actually the owner of Hotstar, a part of the Walt Disney group.
            As Star India group was now a part of the Walt Disney group, their recent collaboration with Hotstar gave Disney an existing platform in India to promote their vast content. Disney made its official debut in India in April and added all of its content on Hotstar.  
            So, if you’re planning to buy a subscription to this platform, consider browsing through our guide to understand what you can stream and what each plan costs.</p>

            <h2>Monthly / Annual</h2>
            <p>Currently, there are two options for subscribers. The Discovery Plus Premium plan comes with a monthly subscription as well as an introductory annual subscription. We have collected the price rates for both and presented them here. You can go over both and decide which option will suit you best. As a fairly new OTT platform in India, you can avail multiple Discovery Plus vouchers to avail of their premium plans at a low cost.
 
              That being said, if you’re wondering how many devices can use discovery plus, the platform offers single-screen availability. You can watch the shows from only a single screen. Let us keep waiting to see if they will come up with multiple screen viewing shortly.</p>
